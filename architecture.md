# 🧱 Architecture Overview

This project follows the **Clean Architecture** pattern to separate concerns and ensure long-term scalability and maintainability.

## 🎯 Design Goals

- Decouple business logic from infrastructure
- Encourage modularity and testability
- Prepare for community contributions and scalability
- Support both GPA and traditional grading systems
- Future-proof for multi-university, multi-language support

---

## 📐 Layers

### 1. Domain
- Pure C# entities and value objects
- No dependencies on other layers

### 2. Application
- Use case logic
- Interfaces for services and persistence
- DTOs and Commands

### 3. Infrastructure
- EF Core implementation
- File storage, email, third-party integrations

### 4. Presentation
- ASP.NET Core API Controllers
- Authentication and Authorization
- Swagger for API documentation

## 🗃 Example Core Entities

- `University`, `Faculty`, `Department`
- `Student`, `Instructor`, `Course`
- `Schedule`, `Lecture`, `Attendance`
- `Enrollment`, `Grade`, `Evaluation`

---

## 🧩 Flexibility & Extensibility

- Built with extensibility in mind — plug new modules easily
- Support for modular grading logic (GPA or custom scales)
- Support for multiple tenants in future releases

---

## 🚧 Next Steps

- Setup base solution structure (✅)
- Implement Student Registration module
- Define ERD & DB context
- Build API endpoints incrementally
